No, he does not exclusively treat LD patients.  However, in some parts of the country, you don't need to be known as an LD "specialist" to see a large number of LD patients walk through your office.  Given the huge problem of underdiagnosis, orthopedists encounter late manifestations of the disease just about every day in their regular practices.  Dr. N. told me that last year, he sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the LD specialists... and he is not the only orthopedists in the town. Let's say that only 2 people per week actually have LD.  That means at the *very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stage manifestations of LD *every year*.  Add in the folks who were diagnosed by neurologists, rheumatologists, GPs, etc, and you can see what kind of problem we have.  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LD patient. He refers most patients to LD specialists, but in extreme cases he puts the patient on medication immediately to minimize the damage (in most cases, to the knees). Gordon is correct when he states that most LD specialists are GPs. -Marc. -- -- --------------------------------------------------------------------- Marc C. Gabriel        -  U.C.

This is a lovely area for anecdotes, but I am sure you are on to something. As a physician, I almost never get sick: usually, when something horrendous is going around, I either don't get it at all or get a very mild case. When I do get really sick, it is always something unusual. This was not the situation when I was in medical school, particularly on pediatrics. I never had younger siblings myself, and when I went on the pediatric wards I suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectious challenges that my body was not ready for. Pediatrics for me was three solid months of illness, and I had a temp of 104 when I took the final exam! I think what happens is that during training, and beyond, we are constantly exposed to new things, and we have the usual reactions to them, so that later on, when challenged with something, it is more likely a re-exposure for us, so we deal with it well and get a mild illness. I don't think it is that the immune system is hyped up in any way. Also, don't forget that the hospital flora is very different from the home, and we carry a lot of that around. -km

MYSTERY ILLNESS WITH SPOTS I attended high school in the San Jose, California area in the early 1980's, and I remember a (smallish) outbreak of a strange illness, in which people developed measles-like spots on their bodies.  This condition seemed to last only a few days, and I don't recall anyone reporting any other symptoms.  I seem to recall reading somewhere that this was believed to have been viral in nature, but I don't know for sure. However, I have been curious since then about this. Anyone have any ideas about what this might have been?

I don't understand the assumption that because something is found to be carcinogenic that "it would not be legal in the U.S.".  I think that naturally occuring substances (excluding "controlled" substances) are pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food, food additives or other "consumption".  It's only when the chemists concoct (sp?) an ingredient that it falls under FDA regulations.  Otherwise, if they really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything. How in the world do you suppose it's legal to "consume" tobacco products (which probably SHOULD be banned)? Dave Allen Space Science & Engr. Ctr. UW-Madison

From THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY GUIDE TO TOTAL NUTRITION: Stanley Gershoff, Ph.D., Dean of Tufts University School of Nutrition; HarperPerennial, 1991 (ISBN #0-06-272007-4): "The greatest hazard of barbecuing is that the cook will not use enough caution and get burned.  Some people suggest that the barbecuing itself is dangerous, because the smoke, which is absorbed by the meat, contains benzopyrene, which, in its pure form, has been known to cause cancer in laboratory animals.  However, in order to experience the same results, people would have to consume unrealistically large quantities of barbecued meat at a time." -Rich Young (These are not Kodak's opinions.)

Whether or not MSG causes describable, >reportable, documentable symptoms should be pretty simple to discover. I tend to disagree- I think anecdotal evidence, provided there is a lot of it, and it is fairly consistent, will is very important.  First, it points to the necessity of doing a study, and second, it at least says that the effects are all psychological (or possibly allergy in this case).  As I've pointed out before, pyschological effects are no less real than other effects.  One person's "make-believe" can easily be another person's reality.  Using psychadelic drugs in a bizarre and twisted example, the hallucinations one person experiences on an acid trip cannot be guaranteed to another person on an acid trip- there is no clinical evidence that those effects are always going to happen.  Anyhow, that was a pretty lame example, but hopefully I made my point- it's all a matter of perception, and as long as someone ingesting MSG perceives it as causing bad effects, then s/he can definitely experience those affects.  On the other hand, it could just be an allergy to the food it's in,   or something.  Still, anecdotal evidence is not worthless- it's the stuff that leads to the study being done. -Dan

food-related seizures? Distribution: world NNTP-Posting-Host: cmb00.larc.nasa.gov I am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in network newsland who has heard of something similar to what I am going to describe here.  I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted Flakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like this before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again. Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think "Oh, oh, this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure."  Ten minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure. When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even he is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when a person has a seizure. Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you can guess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there has.  Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get across what is going on here.

Above, Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre science that makes smaller steps.  In most of this thread, I have been concerned with the difference between what is science and what is not. Lee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between Einstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of their thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts are scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or Korzybski as examples.  If you don't like these, choose your own.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong. Both Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to do this. Let me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked to review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many kinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is that the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of criticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either not important or not interesting.  The first difference is the one that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the one that Lee Lady seems to be discussing. > If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit > to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information. > But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This > is where you and I disagree with Turpin. I have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered scientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims, not just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect that traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work; what it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the presence of qi. > ... In order to have science, one must have a theoretical > structure that makes sense, not a mere collection of empirically > validated random hypotheses. Certainly a "theoretical structure that makes sense" is the goal. In areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with forming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Let's face it: we cannot always wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything clear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. Russell

Whether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window, or dreaming, or having a fantasy,  or watching an apple fall (Newton), or sitting in a bath (Archimedes) ... it is ultimately the result of a lot of intense scientific thinking done beforehand.  Letting one's mind roam freely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of coming up with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis of the problem first. Scientific intuition is not something one is born with.  It is something that one learns.  Maybe we don't understand completely how it is learned, but training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the key elements in developing it. Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding new scientific ideas.  One thinks, for instance, of Darwin's naturalistic studies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for the theory of evolution. This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes empirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal exploration as important scientific work.  I agree that mere speculation does not deserve to be called science.  I also think that mere empirical studies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very poor kind of science.

Re: Barbecued foods and health risk This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw.  Today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique I'd never seen before. He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil. The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray, made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges. In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two teabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves. On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with two chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes. Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises and concerns me are: 1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from? 2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive, caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what? 3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do so. WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens), I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips, getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process, then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips. My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight stuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff, just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct? I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the floor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals. And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually has some standing, don't know about the others. An amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal, when it was discovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were putting a lot of ethylene dibromide (EDB) into the cake mix to suppress weevils. This is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic. The guy who represented the company in the press conference defended himself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every day for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal- broiled steaks.  What a great analogy!  When I first heard that, my immediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit!  One charcoal broiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 Duncans!

Re: What are the problems with Nutrasweet (Aspartame)? Phenylketonuria is a disease in which the body cannot process phenylalanine. It can build up in the blood and cause seizures and neurological damage. An odd side effect is that the urine can be deeply colored, like red wine. People with the condition must avoid Nutrasweet, chocolate, and anything else rich in phenylalanine. Aspartame is accused of having caused various vague neurological symptoms. Pat Robertson's program _The_700_Club_ was beating the drum against aspartame rather vigorously for about a year, but that issue seems to have been pushed to the back burner for the last year or so.  Apparently, the evidence is not very strong, or Pat would still be flailing away.

The danger in philosophizing about science is that theory and generalization can end up being far removed from the actual day-to-day of the grunt at the bench.  Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it (as long as my advisor doesn't catch me - which is easy enough to do), but stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review committees and the peer review process in general.  In today's world that's what determines what science is: what gets funded.  And a damn good thing to. Flights of fantasy just don't have much chance of producing anything, at least not in biomedical research.  The surest way for a graduate student to ruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with fleshing out his/her fantasies than with having the student work on a project that actually has a good chance of producing some results.

Re: Science and methodology  (was: Homeopathy ... tradition?) In article <ls8lnvINNrtb@saltillo.cs.utexas.edu> turpin@cs.utexas.edu (Russell Turpin) writes: >            ... >*not* imply that all their treatments are ineffective.  It *does* >imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are >incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and >which are not.) To start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So there's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a given context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely and makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other hand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which eventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  "You people call THIS science?"   (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees both these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.) Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor appropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science. My second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this is true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific. Within mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before the twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later mathematicians did prove them, of course.) I think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not so much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a matter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of incompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to objectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an essential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step of the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward that goal then one is not doing science.) When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and seems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further investigation. In article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I wrote: > Namely, is there really justification for the belief that > science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches? Admittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable amount of effort in a "serious scholarly investigation" such as I suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately specific question to try and answer. The "science" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century. I certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use of "reason and observation." One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies. Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with the study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there is any existing research related to this question. -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects. lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet

Need advice with doctor-patient relationship problem NNTP-Posting-Host: hsc.usc.edu I need advice with a situation which occurred between me and a physican which upset me.  I saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain. He suggested medication and a course of treatment, and told me that I need to call him 7 days after I begin the medication so that he may monitor its effectiveness, as well as my general health. I did exactly as he asked, and made the call (reaching his secretary). I explained to her that I was following up at the doctor's request, and that I was worried because the pain episodes were becoming more frequent and the medication did not seem effective. The doctor called me back, and his first words were, "Whatever you want, you'd better make it quick.  I'm very busy and don't have time to chit- chat with you!"  I told him I was simply following his instructions to call on the 7th day to status him, and that I was feeling worse.  I then asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he had more time.  He responded, "Just spit it out now because no time is a good time."  (Said in a raised voice.)  I started to feel upset and tried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my nervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttered and then said "well, never mind" and he said he'll talk to various colleagues about other medications and he'll call me some other time. This doctor called me that evening and said because I didn't express myself well, he was confused about what I wanted.  At this point I was pretty upset and I told him (in an amazingly polite voice considering how angry I felt) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings.  He told me that he just doesn't have time to "rap with patients" and thought that was what I wanted.  I told him that to assume I was calling to "rap" was insulting, and said again that I was just following through on his orders.  He responded that he resented the implication that he felt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what his patients have to say about their condition status.  He then gave me this apology: "I am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you mistakenly thought I was insulting.  I am not trying to insult you but I am not that knowledgeable about pain, and I don't have a lot of time to deal with that."  He then told me to call him the next day for further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication. I am still upset and have not yet called. My questions: (1) Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care? (2) Since I am in pain off and on, I realize that this may cause me to be more anxietous so am I perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitive? If this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type of pain I have, he still wants me to status him on my condition but now I am afraid to call him. --Marlena

Hernia A bit more than a year ago, a hernia in my right groin was discovered.  It had produced a dull pain in that area.  The hernia was repaired using the least intrusive (orthoscopic?) method and a "plug and patch". The doctor considered the procedure a success. A few months later the same pain returned.  The doctor said that he could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repair. Now the pain occurs more often.  My GP couldn't identify any specific problem.  The surgen who performed the original procedure now says that yes there is a "new" hernia in the same area and he said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time. My question to the net:  Is there a nonintrusive method to determine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is from something else? Steve Heffner

Rutin is a bioflavonoid, compounds found (among other places) in the rinds of citrus fruits.  These have been popular, especially in Europe, to treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases-- a few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he'd had hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously, I asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active ingredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical sputtering.  I have no idea how he's doing hemorrhoid-wise these days. The studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in human disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the reports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.

I would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors (of the squeaky-clean, traditional crew-cut, talk to the AMA before starting any treatment, kind) who recommend treatments that, though "accepted", may not be necessary for the patient at the time.  And all for making a quick buck.  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the U.S. is significantly inflated by these "quacks of a different color".  In fact, I'd say these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the true focus of the medical profession.

What do they teach you in medical school - how to throw your authority around? Let me put it another way to make my point clear:  "quack" is a nebulous word lacking in any precision.  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand. The indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency;  and coming from any medical doctor (or wanna-be), where competency is expected, is real scary.

Re: THE BACK MACHINE - Update Distribution: na NNTP-Posting-Host: unlinfo.unl.edu I have a BACK MACHINE and have had one since January.  While I have not found it to be a panacea for my back pain, I think it has helped somewhat. It MAINLY acts to stretch muscles in the back and prevent spasms associated with pain.  I am taking less pain medication than I was previously. The folks at BACK TECHNOLOGIES are VERY reluctant to honor their return policy.  They extended my "warranty" period rather than allow me to return the machine when, after the first month or so, I was not thrilled with it. They encouraged me to continue to use it, abeit less vigourously. Like I said, I can't say it is a cure-all, but it keeps me stretched out and I am in less pain. -- *********************************************************************** Dale M.

Re: Can't Breathe Getting back to the original question in this thread: I experienced breathing difficulties a few years ago similar to those described.  In my case, it turned out that I was developing Type I diabetes.  Although I never sought direct confirmation of this from my doctor, I think that the breathing problem was associated with the presence of ketones due to the diabetes. I think that ketosis can occur in lesser degree if one is restricting their food intake drastically.

Re: Science and methodology (was: Homeopathy ... tradition?) Distribution: inet NNTP-Posting-Host: im4u.cs.utexas.edu Summary: More in response to Lee Lady. Keywords: science   errors   Turpin   NLP -*---- I think that part of the problem is that I have proposed a definition of science that I intended to be interpreted broadly and that Lee Lady has interpreted fairly narrowly.  My definition is this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous work.  Lee Lady writes: > I don't think that science should be defined in a way that some > of the activities that lead to really important science --- namely > thinking and informal exploration --- are not recognized as > scientific work. Unless one classifies "thinking and informal exploration" as a mistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would consider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as unscientific. In article <C5nAsF.MH7@news.Hawaii.Edu> lady@uhunix.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu (Lee Lady) writes: > Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect. > I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science > is mainly about avoiding mistakes. ... Here is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not clear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be taken as describing what "science is mainly about."  Consider, for example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and still not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates, that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that some invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are ubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the definition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are "mainly about." The misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition. > Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees > of certainty.

I agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls. As to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about "absolute scientific truth."  I think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have proven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of degree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence. One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim, the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to speculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence was presently available for them, and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.) > The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to > make this simple test.

(Most of them are also just plain not interested, because > the whole idea seems frivolous.

I think a lot of scientists steer away from things that -- deserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many researchers' minds. This is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one wants to become this generation's Rhine. > One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely > unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't > been described in a scientific journal. ... I think this is absurd. > Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done > (with favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because > it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal. I wonder why the results were not published.  In my field, dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly eases one's defense.) Finally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either on NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.  I know little about either and so have nothing to offer. Russell
Re: Barbecued foods and health risk From my reading of the popular, and scientific, literature,  I think that the benzopyrene-from-burned-fat problem is probably real but very small compared to other kinds of risks.  (This type of problem also occurs with stove-top pan grilling.)  One possible remedy I have read about is to take some vitamin C with your meal of barbecue (or bacon, e.g.).  This MAY make sense because vit. C is an antioxidant which could counteract the adverse affect of some of the chemicals in question.

Re: diet for Crohn's (IBD) One thing that I haven't seen in this thread is a discussion of the relation between IBD inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty acids (FAs). I was diagnosed last May w/Crohn's of the terminal ileum. When I got out of the hospital I read up on it a bit, and came across several studies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducing inflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies are discussed in "Inflammatory Bowel Disease," MacDermott, Stenson. 1992.] But if I recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). In the studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of the studies), but, if I recall correctly, there was no restriction of the _other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informed layperson's perspective, this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs are consumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of "bad" prostanoid products to "good" prostanoid products could still be fairly "bad." Isn't this ratio the issue? What's the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPA supplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs appear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10% calories). -Brian <bmdelane@midway.uchicago.edu>

Lupus I have a friend who has just been diagnosed with Lupus, and I know nothing about this disease. The only thing I do know is that this is some sort of skin disease, and my friend shows no skin rashes - in fact, they used a blood test to determine what had been wrong with an on going sacro- illiac joint problem. I am finding a hard time finding information on this disease. Could anyone please enlighten me as to the particulars of this disease. please feel free to E-mail me at bytor@cruzio.santa-cruz.ca.us Thanks in advance.

Re: HELP for Kidney Stones .............. If you think you have kidney stones or your doctor tells you that you do, DEFINITELY follow up on it.  My sister was diagnosed with kidney stones 1 1/2 years ago and given medication to take to dissolve them.  After that failed and she continued to be in great pain, they decided she had endometriosis.  When they did exploratory surgery, they discovered she had a tumor, which turned out to be rhabdomyosarcoma -- a very rare and agressive cancer.  I realize this is not what happens in the majority of cases, but you never know what can happen and shouldn't take chances!

Cohen & N. Indurkhya TUTORIAL PROGRAM Tutorials will be conducted at the Bethesda Ramada Hotel on Tuesday, July 6. 12:00-2:45pm "Introduction to Molecular Biology for Computer Scientists"  Prof. Mick Noordewier (Rutgers University) This overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain. Material covered will include structural and informational molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic material, the "central dogma" of gene expression, and selected other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as relates to current computational approaches.  Dr. Noordewier has appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition to his current work in computational biology. 12:00-2:45pm "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for Biologists"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.) An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological applications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge representation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended audience includes biologists with some computational background, but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. Lathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to biological problems in both academia and industry. 3:00-5:45pm "Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory in Biological Sequence Analysis" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos National Laboratory) This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine learning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic views of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such techniques in this domain. 3:00-5:45pm "Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming" Prof. John Koza (Stanford University) The genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally inspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and characteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will also be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to biological applications, and to identifying resources and software that will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in the field. 3:00-5:45pm "Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis" Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute) Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies are increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and functional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order syntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski has studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area of word-based analyses.

(The tests result in a large number of both false positives and false negatives.  I am in the latter case.)

E.G. homoeopathy: like cures like.  The more you dilute things, the more powerful they get, even if you dilute them so much there is no ingredient but water left.  Chiropractic: all illness stems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae.  Such systems are so patently absurd, that any good they do is accidental and not related to the theory.  The only exception is probably herbalism, because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants and are always interested in seeing if they can find new plants that have active and useful substances.  But that isn't what is meant by alternative medicine, usually.  If you get into the Qi, accupuntunce charts, etc, you are now back to silly theories that probably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some cases. Perhaps another reason they are reluctant is the Rhine experience. Rhine was a scientist who wanted to investigate the paranormal and his lab was filled with so much chacanery and fakery that people don't want to be associated with that sort of thing. -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon." ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re: Sinus vs. Migraine (was Re: Sinus Endoscopy) I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly, (motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only "real solution" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain. The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the "internal nerves" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago. Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that "force" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times. Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain. Janice Rathmann
